Question 1. I added more steps, each step corresponds to an iteration of the while loop. I also added on the step which vertice that the step corresponds to.

Question 4. 37 does not input because the hashmap is not sized well. If it was a prime size then this problem would not happen. 37 loops between index 3 and 8 and never ends up being inserted.

Question 5b. I wasn't sure what technique you wanted us to use. I decided to use a unordered map to save the letters I have linked together. There is likely a better solution but this was simple and there was not specific instructions for how in the hw.
