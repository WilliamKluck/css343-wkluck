For the instructor: Please review 4a.cpp and 4b.cpp and provide feedback on how I could improve these methods.

My main goal in this homework assignment was to create iterative approaches to all these questions. I knew that the recursive solution was likely easier but I knew that the iterative approach is usually better memory-wise.

Below are the links to the questions:
4a: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/928/
4b: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/929/
5a: https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/
5b: https://leetcode.com/problems/open-the-lock/ 
5c: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/930/
